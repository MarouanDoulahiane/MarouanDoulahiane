### **PiPE (Marouan Doulahiane)**

**AI Engineer & Founder** | Architecting [Resumefy.pro](https://resumefy.pro) 🛡️ | Reverse-Engineering the Hiring Algorithm

---

I am a **21-year-old Full Stack AI Engineer** based in **Morocco**.
I don't just write code; I ship systems that force the market to pay attention.

* **By Day:** Building scalable AI infrastructure @ **1337**.
* **By Night:** Founder of **Resumefy**, an AI engine designed to exploit and bypass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

My mission is absolute: **$0 → $10,000 MRR.**
No funding. No investors. Just execution.

### 🛡️ **THE MISSION: SYSTEM EXPLOIT**

The modern hiring market is not broken; it is **automated against you**.
75% of qualified resumes are deleted by bots before a human ever sees them.

I am building the counter-measure.
* **Resumefy.pro** is not a resume builder. It is an **Optimization Layer** that structures candidate data to match enterprise hiring logic.
* We turn "rejected" into "interviewed" by reverse-engineering the keyword matching algorithms used by Fortune 500 companies.

### ⚡ **THE VELOCITY (THE FORGE)**

I believe in **High-Frequency Execution**.

* **The Sprint:** Architected, designed, and deployed the full stack of Resumefy (V2) in **21 days**.
* **The Stack:** NextJS (App Router), NestJS (Backend), Python (AI/LLM Agents), PostgreSQL, Docker.
* **The "Morocco Firewall":** When Stripe and PayPal blocked payments for my region, I didn't stop. I engineered a custom payment pipeline using **Whop + Crypto Infrastructure** to keep the business live.
